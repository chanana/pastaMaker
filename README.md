# pastaMaker
#### concatenates *.ape and *.str files into one fasta file

##### Usage:
1. Put `pastaMaker.py` in a directory containing *.ape and *.str files
2. Double-click or run from the command line.
3. New file called `ravioli.fasta` contains all the files together.

Note: each file in `ravioli.fasta` starts with a `>` character because that's how the lab member wanted it...
